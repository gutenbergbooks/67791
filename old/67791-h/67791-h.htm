<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>HAT was said concerning the author in the preface to the first edition
may be repeated here. He was born at Old Aberdeen on 19 May 1895. From
1900 onwards his home was in Cambridge. He was at Marlborough College
from September 1908 till December 1913, when he was elected to a
scholarship at University College, Oxford. After leaving school he spent
a little more than six months in Germany, returning home on the outbreak
of war. He was gazetted Second Lieutenant in the Seventh (Service)
Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment in August 1914, Lieutenant in
November, and Captain in the following August. His battalion was sent to
France on 30 May. He was killed in action near Hulluch on 13 October
1915. “Being made perfect in a little while, he fulfilled long years.”</p>

<p>Many readers have asked for further information about the author or
contributions from his pen. I am not able to give all that is asked for;
but in this edition I have done what I can to meet the wishes of my
correspondents by appending to the poems a certain number of
illustrations in prose. With the exception of a few sentences from an
early essay, these prose passages are all taken from his letters to his
family and friends. They have been selected as illustrating some idea or
subject mentioned in the poems and prominent in his own mind. But the
relevancy is not always very close; the moods of the moment are
sometimes expressed rather than matured judgments; and it has to be
remembered that what was written was not intended for other eyes than
those of the person to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p>With the poems it is different; and, had he lived, he would probably
himself have published a selection of them with such revision as he
deemed advisable. But when a suggestion about printing was made to him,
soon after he had entered upon his life in the trenches of Flanders, he
put the proposal aside as premature, adding “Besides, this is no time
for oliveyards and vineyards, more especially of the small-holdings
type. For three years or the duration of the war, let be.” His warfare
is now accomplished, and his relatives have felt themselves free to
publish.</p>

<p>The original order of the poems is retained in this edition. The first
place is assigned to the title-poem; some early poems are printed at the
end; the other contents are arranged in the order of their composition,
as nearly as that order could be ascertained. When the date given
includes the day of the month, it has been taken from the author’s
manuscript; some of the other dates are approximate. Of the undated
poems, <small>XIII</small> to <small>XVI</small> were received from him in October 1914, <small>XVII</small> to <small>XXIV</small>
in April 1915, <small>XXVII</small> was found in his kit sent back from France, and
<small>XXVIII</small> (which appeared for the first time in the second edition) was
sent to a friend towards the end of July 1915. A single piece of
imaginative prose has been included amongst the poems.</p>

<p>Some further information regarding them has been obtained recently. <small>XVI</small>
was written when he was at the Officers’ Training Camp at Churn early in
September 1914, and <small>XVII</small> a few days later, <small>XV</small> had its origin in his
journey from Churn to join his regiment at Shorncliffe on 18 September.
The first draft of it was sent to a friend soon afterwards with the
words: “enclosed the poem which eventually came out of the first day of
term at Paddington. Not much trace of the origin left; but I think it
should get a prize for being the first poem written since August 4th
that isn’t patriotic.” This draft differs slightly from the final form
of the poem, and instead of the present title (“Whom therefore we
ignorantly worship”), it is preceded by the verse “And these all, having
obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise.” The
poem called “Lost” (<small>XXIV</small>) was sent to the same friend in December 1914.
“I have tried for long,” he wrote, “to express in words the impression
that the land north of Marlborough must leave”; and he added,
“Simplicity, paucity of words, monotony almost, and mystery are
necessary. I think I have got it at last.” The signpost, which figures
here as well as elsewhere in the poems, stands at “the junction of the
grass tracks on the Aldbourne down&mdash;to Ogbourne, Marlborough,
Mildenhall, and Aldbourne. It stands up quite alone.”</p>

<p>Three of the poems at least&mdash;<small>II</small>, <small>VIII</small>, and <small>XII</small>&mdash;were written entirely in
the open air. Concerning one of these he said, “<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Autumn Dawn’ has too
much copy from Meredith in it, but I value it as being (with ‘Return’) a
memento of my walk to Marlborough last September [1913].” Sending his
“occasional budget” in April 1915 he said, “You will notice that most of
what I have written is as hurried and angular as the handwriting:
written out at different times and dirty with my pocket: but I have had
no time for the final touch nor seem likely to have for some time, and
so send them as they are. Nor have I had time to think out (as I usually
do) a rigorous selection as fit for other eyes. So these are my
explanations of the fall in quality. I like ‘Le Revenant’ best, being
very interested in the previous and future experience of the character
concerned: but it sadly needs the file.”</p>

<p>The letter in verse, fragments of which are given on pages 73-78, was
sent anonymously to an older friend whose connexion with Marlborough is
commemorated in the poem entitled “J. B.” J. B. discovered the
authorship of the epistle by sending the envelope to a Marlborough
master, and replied in the words which, by his permission, are printed
on the opposite page.</p>

<span class="i0">Thy crown of scorn, thy suffering’s sharp spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hopes, thy longings&mdash;only not thy dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love (for my crying love would no man hear),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy will to love, but not thy love’s sweet graces,<br /></span>

BEHIND THE LINES</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>E are now at the end of a few days’ rest, a kilometre behind the lines.
Except for the farmyard noises (new style) it might almost be the little
village that first took us to its arms six weeks ago. It has been a fine
day, following on a day’s rain, so that the earth smells like spring. I
have just managed to break off a long conversation with the farmer in
charge, a tall thin stooping man with sad eyes, in trouble about his
land: les Anglais stole his peas, trod down his corn and robbed his
young potatoes: he told it as a father telling of infanticide. There may
have been fifteen francs’ worth of damage done; he will never get
compensation out of those shifty Belgian burgomasters; but it was not
exactly the fifteen francs but the invasion of the soil that had been
his for forty years, in which the weather was his only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span> enemy, that gave
him a kind of Niobe’s dignity to his complaint.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there is the usual evening sluggishness. Close by, a
quickfirer is pounding away its allowance of a dozen shells a day. It is
like a cow coughing. Eastward there begins a sound (all sounds begin at
sundown and continue intermittently till midnight, reaching their zenith
at about 9 p.m. and then dying away as sleepiness claims their
masters)&mdash;a sound like a motor-cycle race&mdash;thousands of motor-cycles
tearing round and round a track, with cut-outs out: it is really a pair
of machine guns firing. And now one sound awakens another. The old cow
coughing has started the motor-bykes: and now at intervals of a few
minutes come express trains in our direction: you can hear them rushing
toward us; they pass going straight for the town behind us: and you hear
them begin to slow down as they reach the town: they will soon stop: but
no, every time, just before they reach it, is a tremendous railway
accident. At least, it must be a railway accident, there is so much
noise, and you can see the dust that the wreckage scatters. Sometimes
the train behind comes very close, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span> it too smashes on the wreckage
of its forerunners. A tremendous cloud of dust, and then the groans. So
many trains and accidents start the cow coughing again: only another cow
this time, somewhere behind us, a tremendous-sized cow, θαυμἀσιον ὄσιον,
with awful whooping-cough. It must be a buffalo: this cough must burst
its sides. And now someone starts sliding down the stairs on a tin tray,
to soften the heart of the cow, make it laugh and cure its cough. The
din he makes is appalling. He is beating the tray with a broom now,
every two minutes a stroke: he has certainly stopped the cow by this
time, probably killed it. He will leave off soon (thanks to the “shell
tragedy”): we know he can’t last.</p>

<p>It is now almost dark: come out and see the fireworks. While waiting for
them to begin you can notice how pale and white the corn is in the
summer twilight: no wonder with all this whooping-cough about. And the
motor-cycles: notice how all these races have at least a hundred
entries: there is never a single cycle going. And why are there no birds
coming back to roost? Where is the lark? I haven’t heard him all to-day.
He must have got whooping-cough as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span> well, or be staying at home through
fear of the cow. I think it will rain to-morrow, but there have been no
swallows circling low, stroking their breasts on the full ears of corn.
Anyhow, it is night now, but the circus does not close till twelve.
Look! there is the first of them! The fireworks are beginning. Red
flares shooting up high into the night, or skimming low over the ground,
like the swallows that are not: and rockets bursting into stars. See how
they illumine that patch of ground a mile in front. See it, it is deadly
pale in their searching light: ghastly, I think, and featureless except
for two big lines of eyebrows ashy white, parallel along it, raised a
little from its surface. Eyebrows. Where are the eyes? Hush, there are
no eyes. What those shooting flares illumine is a mole. A long thin
mole. Burrowing by day, and shoving a timorous enquiring snout above the
ground by night. Look, did you see it? No, you cannot see it from here.
But were you a good deal nearer, you would see behind that snout a long
and endless row of sharp shining teeth. The rockets catch the light from
these teeth and the teeth glitter: they are silently removed from the
poison-spitting gums of the mole. For the mole’s gums spit fire and,
they say, send<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span> something more concrete than fire darting into the
night. Even when its teeth are off. But you cannot see all this from
here: you can only see the rockets and then for a moment the pale ground
beneath. But it is quite dark now.</p>

<p>And now for the fun of the fair! You will hear soon the riding-master
crack his whip&mdash;why, there it is. Listen, a thousand whips are cracking,
whipping the horses round the ring. At last! The fun of the circus is
begun. For the motor-cycle team race has started off again: and the
whips are cracking all: and the waresman starts again, beating his loud
tin tray to attract the customers: and the cows in the cattle-show start
coughing, coughing: and the firework display is at its best: and the
circus specials come one after another bearing the merry makers back to
town, all to the inevitable crash, the inevitable accident. It can’t
last long: these accidents are so frequent, they’ll all get soon killed
off, I hope. Yes, it is diminishing. The train service is cancelled (and
time too): the cows have stopped coughing: and the cycle race is done.
Only the kids who have bought new whips at the fair continue to crack
them: and unused rockets that lie about the ground are still sent up
occasionally. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> now the children are being driven off to bed: only an
occasional whip-crack now (perhaps the child is now the sufferer): and
the tired showmen going over the ground pick up the rocket-sticks and
dead flares. At least I suppose this is what must be happening: for
occasionally they still find one that has not gone off and send it up
out of mere perversity. Else what silence!</p>

<p>It must be midnight now. Yes, it is midnight. But before you go to bed,
bend down, put your ear against the ground. What do you hear? “I hear an
endless tapping and a tramping to and fro: both are muffled: but they
come from everywhere. Tap, tap, tap: pick, pick, pick: tra-mp, tra-mp,
tra-mp.” So you see the circus-goers are not all gone to sleep. There is
noise coming from the womb of earth, noise of men who tap and mine and
dig and pass to and fro on their watch. What you have seen is the foam
and froth of war: but underground is labour and throbbing and long
watch. Which will one day bear their fruit. They will set the circus on
fire. Then what pandemonium! Let us hope it will not be to-morrow!</p>

<h2><a name="ILLUSTRATIONS_IN_PROSE" id="ILLUSTRATIONS_IN_PROSE"></a>ILLUSTRATIONS IN PROSE</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="c"><small>RICHARD JEFFERIES</small> (<a href="#page_27">p. 27</a>)</p>

<p>I am sweatily struggling to the end of <i>Faust II</i>, where Goethe’s just
showing off his knowledge. I am also reading a very interesting book on
Goethe and Schiller; very adoring it is, but it lets out quite
unconsciously the terrible dryness of their entirely intellectual
friendship and (Goethe’s at least) entirely intellectual life. If Goethe
really died saying “more light,” it was very silly of him: what <i>he</i>
wanted was more warmth. G. and S. apparently made friends, on their own
confession, merely because their ideas and artistic ideals were the
same, which fact ought to be the very first to make them bore one
another.</p>

<p>All this is leading to the following conclusion. The Germans can act
Shakespeare, have good beer and poetry, but their prose is cobwebby
stuff. Hence I want to read some good prose again. Also it is summer.
And for a year or two I had always laid up “The Pageant of Summer” as a
treat for a hot July. In spite of all former vows of celibacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> in the
way of English, now’s the time. So, unless the cost of book-postage here
is ruinous, could you send me a small volume of Essays by Richard
Jefferies called <i>The Life of the Fields</i>, the first essay in the series
being the Pageant of Summer? No particular hurry, but I should be
amazingly grateful if you’ll send it (it’s quite a little book),
especially as I presume the pageant of summer takes place in that part
of the country where I should be now had&mdash;&mdash;had a stronger will than
you. In the midst of my setting up and smashing of deities&mdash;Masefield,
Hardy, Goethe&mdash;I always fall back on Richard Jefferies wandering about
in the background. I have at least the tie of locality with him. (<i>July
1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>I’ve given up German prose altogether. It’s like a stale cake compounded
of foreign elements. So I have laid in a huge store of Richard Jefferies
for the rest of July, and read him none the less voraciously because we
are countrymen. (I know it’s wrong of me, but I count myself as
Wiltshire....) When I die (in sixty years) I am going to leave all my
presumably enormous fortune to Marlborough on condition that a thorough
knowledge of Richard Jefferies is ensured by the teaching there. I think
it is only right considering we are bred upon the self-same hill. It
would also encourage Naturalists and discourage cricketers....<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<p>But, in any case. I’m not reading so much German as I did ought to. I
dabble in their modern poetry, which is mostly of the morbidly religious
kind. The language is massively beautiful, the thought is rich and
sleek, the air that of the inside of a church. Magnificent artists they
are, with no inspiration, who take religion up as a very responsive
subject for art, and mould it in their hands like sticky putty. There
are magnificent parts in it, but you can imagine what a relief it was to
get back to Jefferies and Liddington Castle. (<i>July 1914.</i>)</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="c"><small>IBSEN</small> (pp. 50-52)</p>

<p>Ibsen’s last, <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>, is a wonderfully fine play, far
better than any others by Ibsen that I have read or seen, but I can
imagine it would lose a good deal in an English translation. The acting
of the two middle-aged sisters who are the protagonists was marvellous.
The men were a good deal more difficult to hear, but also very striking.
Next to the fineness of the play (which has far more poetry in it than
any others of his I’ve read, though of course there’s a bank in the
background, as there always seems to be in Ibsen)&mdash;the apathy of the
very crowded house struck me most. There was very little clapping at the
end<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span> at the acts: at the end of the play none, which was just as well
because one of them was dead and would have had to jump up again. So
altogether I am very much struck by my first German theatre, though the
fineness of the play may have much to do with it. It was just a little
spoilt by the last Act being in a pine forest on a hill with sugar that
was meant to look like snow. This rather took away from the effect of
the scene, which in the German is one of the finest things I have ever
heard, possessing throughout a wonderful rhythm which may or may not
exist in the original. What a beautiful language it can be! (<i>13
February 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>I have been reading many criticisms of <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>, and it
strikes me more and more that it is the most remarkable play I have ever
read. It is head and shoulders above the others of Ibsen’s I know: a
much broader affair. John Gabriel Borkman is a tremendous character. His
great desire, which led him to overstep the law for one moment, and of
course he was caught and got eight years, was “Menschenglück zu
schaffen.” One moment Ibsen lets you see one side of his character (the
side he himself saw) and you see the Perfect Altruist: the next moment
the other side is turned, and you see the Complete Egoist. The play all
takes place in the last three hours of J. G. B.’s life, and in these
three hours his real love, whom he had rejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span> for business reasons
and married her twin-sister, shows him for the first time the Egoist
that masqueraded all its life as Altruist. The technique is perfect and
it bristles with minor problems. It is absolutely fair, for if J. G. B.
had sacrificed his ideals and married the right twin, he would not have
been deserted after his disgrace. And the way that during the three
hours the whole past history of the man comes out is marvellous. The
brief dialogue between the sisters which closes the piece is fine, and
suddenly throws a new light on the problem of how the tragedy could have
been evaded, when you thought all that could be said had been said. (<i>20
February 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>I feel that this visit to Schwerin will spoil me for the theatre for the
rest of my life. I have never ceased to see <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>
mentally since my second visit to it (when the acting was even liner
than before and struck me as a perfect presentation of a perfect play).
My only regret was that the whole family wasn’t there as well. I should
so like to talk it over with you, and the way that at the very end of
his last play Ibsen sums up the object against which all his battle was
directed: “Es war viel mehr die Kälte die ihn tötete.” “Die Kälte, sagst
du, die Kälte! die hat ihn schon längst getötet.”... “Ja, die
Herzenskälte.” (<i>10 April 1914.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>[The play] at the Königliches Schauspielhaus [Berlin] was Ibsen’s <i>Peer
Gynt</i> with Grieg’s incidental music&mdash;the Northern Faust, as it is
called: though the mixture of allegory and reality is not carried off so
successfully as in the Southern Faust. Peer Gynt has the advantage of
being a far more human and amiable creature, and not a cold fish like
Faust. I suppose that difference is also to be found in the characters
of the respective authors. I always wanted to know why Faust had no
relations to make demands on him. Peer Gynt is a charmingly light piece,
with an irresistible mixture of fantastical poetry and a very racy
humour. The scene where Peer returns to his blind and dying mother and,
like a practical fellow, instead of sentimentalizing, sits himself on
the end of her bed, persuades her it is a chariot and rides her up to
heaven, describing the scenes on the way, the surliness of St Peter at
the gate, the appearance of God the Father, who “put Peter quite in the
shade” and decided to let mother Aasa in, was delightful. The acting was
of course perfect. (<i>5 June 1914.</i>)</p>

<p class="c"><small>THE ODYSSEY</small> (<a href="#page_73">p. 73</a>)</p>

<p>The <i>Odyssey</i> is a great joy when once you can read it in big chunks and
not a hundred lines at a time, being [forced] to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> note all the silly
grammatical strangenesses. I could not read it in better surroundings
for the whole tone of the book is so thoroughly German and domestic. A
friend of sorts of the &mdash;&mdash;s died lately; and when the Frau attempted
to break the news to Karl at table, he immediately said “Don’t tell me
anything sad while I’m eating.” That very afternoon I came across
someone in the <i>Odyssey</i> who made, under the same circumstances,
precisely the same remark<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. In the <i>Odyssey</i> and in Schwerin alike
they are perfectly unaffected about their devotion to good food. In both
too I find the double patriotism which suffers not a bit from its
duplicity&mdash;in the <i>Odyssey</i> to their little Ithaca as well as to Achaea
as a whole; here equally to the Kaiser and the pug-nosed Grand Duke. In
both is the habit of longwinded anecdotage in the same rambling
irrelevant way, and the quite unquenchable hospitality. And the Helen of
the <i>Odyssey</i> bustling about a footstool for Telemachus or showing off
her new presents (she had just returned from a jaunt to Egypt)&mdash;a
washing-tub, and a work-basket that ran on wheels (think!)&mdash;is the
perfect German Hausfrau. (<i>27 March 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>If I had the smallest amount of patience, steadiness or concentrative
faculty, I could write a brilliant book comparing life in Ithaca, Sparta
and holy Pylos in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span> time of Odysseus with life in
Mecklenburg-Schwerin in the time of Herr Dr &mdash;&mdash;. In both you get the
same unquenchable hospitality and perfectly unquenchable anecdotage
faculty. In both whenever you make a visit or go into a house, they are
“busying themselves with a meal.” Du lieber Karl (I mean Herr Dr &mdash;&mdash;)
has three times, when his wife has tried to talk of death, disease or
crime by table, unconsciously given a literal translation of
Peisistratus’s sound remark οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε τέρπουʹ ὀδυρόμενος
μεταδόρπιοσ<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;and that is their attitude to meals throughout. Need I
add the ἀγλαὰ δῶρα they insist on giving their guests, with the opinion
that it is the host that is the indebted party and the possession of a
guest confers honour and responsibility: and their innate patriotism,
the οὔ τοι ἐγώ γε ἦς γαίης δύναμαι γλυκερώτερον ἄλλο ἰδέσθαι<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> spirit
(however dull it is)&mdash;to complete the parallel? So I am really reading
it in sympathetic surroundings, and when I have just got past the part
where Helen shows off to Menelaus her new work-basket that runs on
wheels, and the Frau rushes in to show me her new water-can with a spout
designed to resemble a pig&mdash;I see the two are made from the same stuff
(I mean, of course, Helen and Frau &mdash;&mdash;, not Frau &mdash;&mdash; and the pig). Also,
I enjoy being able to share in a quiet amateur way<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span> with Odysseus his
feelings about “were it but the smoke leaping up from his own land.”
(<i>23 April 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Good luck to Helen of Troy. As you say, she loved her own sex as well.
Her last appearance in Homer is when Telemachus was just leaving her and
Menelaus after paying them a visit in Sparta, and she stood on the
doorstep with a robe in her hand and spoke a word and called him ‘I also
am giving thee a gift, dear child,&mdash;this, a memorial of Helen’s
handiwork, against the day of thy marriage to which we all look forward,
that thou mayest give it to thy wife: till then, let it be stored in thy
palace under thy mother’s care.’<span class="lftspc">”</span> But she never gives to me the
impression in Homer of being quite happy. I’m sure she was always dull
down in Sparta with fatherly old Menelaus&mdash;though she never showed it of
course. But there is always something a little wistful in her way of
speaking. She only made other people happy and consequently another set
of other people miserable. One of the best things in the <i>Iliad</i> is the
way you are made to feel (without any statement) that Helen fell really
in love with Hector&mdash;and this shows her good taste, for of all the
Homeric heroes Hector is the only unselfish man. She seems to me only to
have loved to please Menelaus and Paris but to have really loved
Hector&mdash;and naturally for Hector and Achilles, the altruist and the
egoist, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> miles nobler than any one else on either side&mdash;but Hector
never gave any sign that he regarded her as anything more than his
distressed sister-in-law. But after Hector’s death she must have left
part of her behind her, and made a real nice wife to poor pompous
Menelaus in his old age. She seems to have had a marvellous power of
adaptability. (<i>April 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>I made my pilgrimage on Saturday, when, though I had to get up with the
lark to hear the energetic old Eucken lecture at 7 a.m., I had no
lecture after 10, and went straight off to Weimar. I spent the rest of
the morning (actually) in the museum, inspecting chiefly Preller’s
wall-paintings of the <i>Odyssey</i>. They are the best criticism of the book
I have seen and gave me a new and more pleasant idea of Odysseus. Weimar
does not give the same impression of musty age as parts of Jena. It
seems a flourishing well-watered town, and I should like very much to
live there, chiefly for the sake of the park. The name “Park” puts one
off, but it is really a beautiful place like a college garden on an
extensive scale. After I had wandered about there very pleasantly for an
hour or so, I noticed a statue in a prominent position above me.
“Another Goethe,” thought I; but I looked at it again, and it had not
that look of self-confident self-conscious greatness that all the
Goethes have. So I went up to it and recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span> a countryman&mdash;looking
down from this height on Weimar, with one eye half-closed and an
attitude of head expressing amused and tolerant but penetrating
interest. It was certainly the first satisfactory representation of
Shakespeare I have ever seen. It appears quite new, but I could not
discover the sculptor’s name. The one-eye-half-closed trick was most
effective; you thought “this is a very humorous kindly human
gentleman”&mdash;then you went round to the other side and saw the open eye!</p>

<p>The blot in Weimar is the Schiller-Goethe statue in front of the
theatre. They are both embracing rather stupidly&mdash;and O so fat! (<i>8 May
1914.</i>)</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="c"><small>GERMANY</small> (<a href="#page_56">p. 56</a>)</p>

<p>In the evening I am generally to be found avoiding a certain insincere
type of German student, who hunts me down ostensibly to “tie a bond of
good-comradeship,” but really to work up facts about what “England”
thinks. Such people of undeveloped individuality tell me in return what
“wir Deutschen” think, in a touching national spirit, which would have
charmed Plato. But they don’t charm me. Indeed I see in them the very
worst result of 1871.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span> They have no idea beyond the “State,” and have
put me off Socialism for the rest of my life. They are not the kind of
people, as [the Irish R.M.] puts it, “you could borrow half-a-crown to
get drunk with.” But such is only a small proportion and come from the
north and west; they just show how Sedan has ruined one type of German,
for I’m sure the German nature is the nicest in the world, as far as it
is not warped by the German Empire. I like their lack of reserve and
self-consciousness, our two national virtues. They all write poetry and
recite it with gusto to any three hours’ old acquaintance. We all write
poetry too in England, but we write it on the bedroom wash-stand and
lock the bedroom door, and disclaim it vehemently in public. (<i>2 June
1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The two great sins people impute to Germany are that she says that might
is right and bullies the little dogs. But I don’t think she means that
might <i>qua</i> might is right, but that confidence of superiority is right,
and by superiority she means spiritual superiority. She said to Belgium,
“We enlightened thinkers see that it is necessary to the world that all
opposition to Deutsche Kultur should be crushed. As citizens of the
world you must assist us in our object and assert those higher ideas of
world citizenship which are not bound by treaties. But if you oppose us,
we have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span> one alternative.” That, at least, is what the best of them
would have said; only the diplomats put it rather more brusquely, She
was going on a missionary voyage with all the zest of Faust&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Er wandle so den Erdentag entlang;<br /></span>

<p class="nind">&mdash;and missionaries know no law....</p>

<p>So it seems to me that Germany’s only fault (and I think you often
commented on it in those you met) is a lack of real insight and sympathy
with those who differ from her. We are not fighting a bully, but a
bigot. They are a young nation and don’t yet see that what they consider
is being done for the good of the world may be really being done for
self-gratification&mdash;like X. who, under pretence of informing the form,
dropped into the habit of parading his own knowledge. X. incidentally
did the form a service by creating great amusement for it, and so is
Germany incidentally doing the world a service (though not in the way it
meant) by giving them something to live and die for, which no country
but Germany had before. If the bigot conquers he will learn in time his
mistaken methods (for it is only of the methods and not of the goal of
Germany that one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> disapprove)&mdash;just as the early Christian bigots
conquered by bigotry and grew larger in sympathy and tolerance after
conquest. I regard the war as one between sisters, between Martha and
Mary, the efficient and intolerant against the casual and sympathetic.
Each side has a virtue for which it is fighting, and each that virtue’s
supplementary vice. And I hope that whatever the material result of the
conflict, it will purge these two virtues of their vices, and efficiency
and tolerance will no longer be incompatible.</p>

<p>But I think that tolerance is the larger virtue of the two, and
efficiency must be her servant. So I am quite glad to fight against this
rebellious servant. In fact I look at it this way. Suppose my platoon
were the world. Then my platoon sergeant would represent efficiency and
I would represent tolerance. And I always take the sternest measures to
keep my platoon sergeant in check! I fully appreciate the wisdom of the
War Office when they put inefficient officers to rule sergeants. Adsit
omen.</p>

<p>Now you know what Sorley thinks about it. And do excuse all his gassing.
I know I already overdosed you on those five splendid days between
Coblenz and Neumagen. But I’ve seen the Fatherland (I like to call it
the Fatherland, for in many families Papa represents efficiency and
Mamma tolerance ... but don’t think I’m W.S.P.U.) so horribly
misrepresented that I’ve been burning to put in my case for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span> them to a
sympathetic ear. Wir sind gewiss Hamburger Jungen, as that lieber
besoffener Österreicher told us. And so we must stand up for them, even
while trying to knock them down. (<i>October 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>On return to England, by the way, I renewed my acquaintance with Robert
Browning. The last line of <i>Mr Sludge the Medium</i>&mdash;“yet there is
something in it, tricks and all”&mdash;converted me, and since then I have
used no other. I wish we could recall him from the stars and get him to
write a Dramatic Idyll or something, giving a soliloquy of the feelings
and motives and quick changes of heat and cold that must be going
through the poor Kaiser’s mind at present. He would really show that
impartial sympathy for him, which the British press and public so
doltishly deny him, when in talk and comment they deny him even the
rights of a human being. R. B. could do it perfectly&mdash;or Shakespeare. I
think the Kaiser not unlike Macbeth, with the military clique in Prussia
as his Lady Macbeth, and the court flatterers as the three weird
sisters. He’ll be a splendid field for dramatists and writers in days to
come. (<i>October 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>It [a magazine article] brought back to me that little crooked old
fellow that Hopkinson and I met at the fag-end of our hot day’s walk as
we swung into Neumagen. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span> little face was lit with a wild uncertain
excitement he had not known since 1870, and he advanced towards us
waving his stick and yelling at us “Der Krieg ist los, Junge,” just as
we might be running to watch a football match and he was come to tell us
we must hurry up for the game had begun. And then the next night on the
platform at Trier, train after train passing crowded with soldiers bound
for Metz: varied once or twice by a truck-load of “swarthier alien
crews,” thin old women like wineskins, with beautiful and piercing
faces, and big heavy men and tiny aged-looking children: Italian
colonists exiled to their country again. Occasionally one of the men
would jump out to fetch a glass of water to relieve their thirst in all
that heat and crowding. The heat of the night is worse than the heat of
the day, and geistige Getränke were verboten. Then the train would
slowly move out into the darkness that led to Metz and an exact
reproduction of it would steam in and fill its place: and we watched the
signal on the southward side of Trier, till the lights should give a
jump and the finger drop and let in the train which was to carry us out
of that highly-strung and thrilling land.</p>

<p>At Cologne I saw a herd of some thirty American school-pmarms whom I had
assisted to entertain at Eucken’s just a fortnight before. I shouted out
to them, but they were far too upset to take any notice, but went
bobbing into one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span> compartment and out again and into another like people
in a cinematograph. Their haste anxiety and topsyturviness were caused
by thoughts of their own safety and escape, and though perfectly natural
contrasted so strangely with all the many other signs of haste
perturbation and distress that I had seen, which were much quieter and
stronger and more full-bodied than that of those Americans, because it
was the Vaterland and not the individual that was darting about and
looking for the way and was in need: and the silent submissive
unquestioning faces of the dark uprooted Italians peering from the
squeaking trucks formed a fitting background&mdash;Cassandra from the
backmost car looking steadily down on Agamemnon as he stepped from his
triumphal purple chariot and Clytemnestra offered him her hand. (<i>23
November 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>It is surprising how very little difference a total change of
circumstances and prospects makes in the individual. The German (I know
from the 48 hours of the war that I spent there) is radically changed,
and until he is sent to the front, his one dream and thought will be how
quickest to die for his country. He is able more clearly to see the
tremendous issues, and changes accordingly. I don’t know whether it is
because the English are more phlegmatic or more shortsighted or more
egoistic or what, that makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span> them inwardly and outwardly so far less
shaken by the war than at first seemed probable. The German, I am sure,
during the period of training “dies daily” until he is allowed to die.
We go there with our eyes shut. (<i>28 November 1914.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>We had a very swinging Christmas&mdash;one that makes one realize (in common
with other incidents of the war) how near savages we are and how much
the stomach (which Nietzsche calls the Father of Melancholy) is also the
best procurer of enjoyment. We gave the men a good church&mdash;plenty of
loud hymns&mdash;, a good dinner&mdash;plenty of beer&mdash;, and the rest of the day
was spent in sleep. I saw then very clearly that whereas for the upper
classes Christmas is a spiritual debauch in which one remembers for a
day to be generous and cheerful and open-handed, it is only a more or
less physical debauch for the poorer classes, who need no reminder,
since they are generous and cheerful and open-handed all the year round.
One has fairly good chances of observing the life of the barrack-room,
and what a contrast to the life of a house in a public school! The
system is roughly the same: the house-master or platoon-commander
entrusts the discipline of his charge to prefects or corporals, as the
case may be. They never open their mouths in the barrack-room without
the introduction of the unprintable swear-words and epithets: they have
absolutely no<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> “morality” (in the narrower, generally accepted sense):
yet the public school boy should live among them to learn a little
Christianity: for they are so extraordinarily nice to one another. They
live in and for the present: we in and for the future. So they are
cheerful and charitable always: and we often niggardly and unkind and
spiteful. In the gymnasium at Marlborough, how the few clumsy specimens
are ragged and despised and jeered at by the rest of the squad; in the
gymnasium here you should hear the sounding cheer given to the man who
has tried for eight weeks to make a long-jump of eight feet and at last
by the advice and assistance of others has succeeded. They seem
instinctively to regard a man singly, at his own rate, by his own
standards and possibilities, not in comparison with themselves or
others: that’s why they are so far ahead of us in their treatment and
sizing up of others.</p>

<p>It’s very interesting, what you say about Athens and Sparta, and England
and Germany. Curious, isn’t it, that in old days a nation fought another
for land or money: now we are fighting Germany for her spiritual
qualities&mdash;thoroughness, and fearlessness of effort, and effacement of
the individual. I think that Germany, in spite of her vast bigotry and
blindness, is in a kind of way living up to the motto that Goethe left
her in the closing words of Faust, before he died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span></p>

sunk deep in “Denkfaulheit,” trying to catch in the distant but
incessant upper thunder of the air promise of October rainstorms: long
runs clad only in jersey and shorts over the Marlborough downs, cloked

<p class="c">“<small>ETERNALLY TO DO</small>” (<a href="#page_71">p. 71</a>)</p>

<p>Masefield has founded a new school of poetry and given a strange example
to future poets; and this is wherein his greatness and originality lies:
that he is a man of action not imagination. For he has one of the
fundamental qualities of a great poet&mdash;a thorough enjoyment of life. He
has it in a more pre-eminent degree than even Browning, perhaps the
stock instance of a poet who was great because he liked life. Everyone
has read the latter’s lines about “the wild joys of living, the leaping
from rock up to rock.” These are splendid lines: but one somehow does
not feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> Browning ever leapt from rock up to rock himself. He saw
other people doing it, doubtless, and thought it fine. But I don’t think
he did it himself ever....</p>

<p>Masefield writes that he knows and testifies that he has seen.
Throughout his poems there are lines and phrases so instinct with life,
that they betoken a man who writes of what he has experienced, not of
what he thinks he can imagine: who has braved the storm, who has walked
in the hells, who has seen the reality of life: who does not, like
Tennyson, shut off the world he has to write about, attempting to
imagine shipwrecks from the sofa, or battles in his bed. Compare for
instance <i>Enoch Arden</i> and <i>Dauber</i>. One is a dream: the other, life....</p>

<p>The sower, who reaps not, has found a voice at last&mdash;a harsh rough
voice, compelling, strong, triumphant. Let us, the reapers where we have
not sown, give ear to it. Are they not much better than we? The voice of
our poets and men of letters is finely trained and sweet to hear; it
teems with sharp saws and rich sentiment: it is a marvel of delicate
technique: it pleases, it flatters, it charms, it soothes: it is a
living lie. The voice of John Masefield rings rough and ill trained: it
tells a story, it leaves the thinking to the reader, it gives him no
dessert of sentiment, cut, dried,&mdash;and ready made to go to sleep on: it
jars, it grates, it makes him wonder; it is full of hope and faith and
power and strife<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span> and God. Till Mr Masefield came on earth, the poetry
of the world had been written by the men who lounged, who looked on. It
is sin in a man to write of the world before he has known the world, and
the failing of every poet up till now has been that he has written of
what he loved to imagine but dared not to experience. But Masefield
writes that he knows and testifies that he has seen; with him expression
is the fruit of action, the sweat of a body that has passed through the
fire.</p>

<p>We stand by the watershed of English poetry; for the vastness and wonder
of modern life has demanded that men should know what they write about.
Behind us are the poets of imagination; before us are the poets of fact.
For Masefield as a poet may be bad or good: I think him good, but you
may think him bad: but, good or bad, he has got this quality which no
one can deny and few belittle. He is the first of a multitude of coming
poets (so I trust and pray) who are men of action before they are men of
speech and men of speech because they are men of action. Those whom,
because they do not live in our narrow painted groove, we call the Lower
Classes, it is they who truly know what life is: so to them let us look
for the true expression of life. One has already arisen, and his name is
Masefield. We await the coming of others in his train. (<i>Essay on
Masefield</i>, <i>3 November 1912</i>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span></p>

<p>The war is a chasm in time.... In a job like this, one lives in times a
year ago&mdash;and a year hence, alternately. Keine Nachricht. A large amount
of organized disorderliness, killing the spirit. A vagueness and a
dullness everywhere: an unromantic sitting still 100 yards from Brother
Bosch. There’s something rotten in the state of something. One feels it
but cannot be definite of what. Not even is there the premonition of
something big impending: gathering and ready to burst. None of that
feeling of confidence, offensiveness, “personal ascendancy,” with which
the reports so delight our people at home. Mutual helplessness and
lassitude, as when two boxers who have battered each other crouch
dancing two paces from each other, waiting for the other to hit.
Improvised organization, with its red hat, has muddled out romance. It
is not the strong god of the Germans&mdash;that makes their Prussian Beamter
so bloody and their fight against fearful odds so successful. Our
organization is like a nasty fat old frowsy cook dressed up in her
mistress’s clothes: fussy, unpopular, and upstart: trailing the scent of
the scullery behind her. In periods of rest we are billeted in a town of
sewage farms, mean streets, and starving cats: delightful population:
but an air of late June weariness. For Spring again! This is not Hell as
I hoped, but Limbo Lake with green growths on the water, full of
minnows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<p>So one lives in a year ago&mdash;and a year hence. What are your feet doing,
a year hence?... where, while riding in your Kentish lanes, are you
riding twelve months hence? I am sometimes in Mexico, selling cloth: or
in Russia, doing Lord knows what: in Serbia or the Balkans: in England,
never. England remains the dream, the background: at once the memory and
the ideal. Sorley is the Gaelic for wanderer. I have had a conventional
education: Oxford would have corked it. But this has freed the spirit,
glory be. Give me the <i>Odyssey</i>, and I return the New Testament to
store. Physically as well as spiritually, give me the road.</p>

<p>Only sometimes the horrible question of bread and butter shadows the
dream: it has shadowed many, I should think. It must be tackled. But I
always seek to avoid the awkward, by postponing it.</p>

<p>You figure in these dreams as the pioneer-sergeant. Perhaps <i>you</i> are
the Odysseus, I am but one of the dog-like έταῖροι.... But however that
may be, our lives will be πολύπλαγκτοι, though our paths may be
different. And we will be buried by the sea&mdash;</p>

<p class="c">“<span class="smcap">THE GRANDEUR OF THEIR MESS</span>” (<a href="#page_74">p. 74</a>)</p>

<p>I am bleached with chalk and grown hairy. And I think exultantly and
sweetly of the one or two or three outstandingly admirable meals of my
life. One in Yorkshire, in an inn upon the moors, with a fire of logs
and ale and tea and every sort of Yorkshire bakery, especially bears me
company. And yet another in Mecklenburg-Schwerin (where they are very
English) in a farm-house utterly at peace in broad fields sloping to the
sea. I remember a tureen of champagne in the middle of the table to
which we helped ourselves with ladles! I remember my hunger after three
hours’ ride over the country: and the fishing-town of Wismar lying like
an English town on the sea. In that great old farm-house where I dined
at 3 p.m. as the May day began to cool, fruit of sea and of land joined
hands together, fish fresh caught and ducks fresh killed: it was a
wedding of the elements. It was perhaps the greatest meal I have had
ever, for everything we ate had been alive that morning&mdash;the champagne
was alive yet. We feasted like kings till the sun sank, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span> it was
impossible to overeat. ’Twas Homeric and its memory fills many hungry
hours. (<i>5 October 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p class="c">“<span class="smcap">THE OLD WAR-JOY, THE OLD WAR-PAIN</span>” (<a href="#page_76">p. 76</a>)</p>

<p>This is a little hamlet, smelling pleasantly of manure. I have never
felt more restful. We arrived at dawn: white dawn across the plane trees
and coming through the fields of rye. After two hours in an oily ship
and ten in a grimy train, the “war area” was a haven of relief. These
French trains shriek so: there is no sight more desolating than
abandoned engines passing up and down the lines, hooting in their
loneliness. There is something eerie in a railway by night.</p>

<p>But this is perfect. The other officers have heard the heavy guns and
perhaps I shall soon. They make perfect cider in this valley: still,
like them. There are clouds of dust along the roads, and in the leaves:
but the dust here is native and caressing and pure, not like the dust of
Aldershot, gritted and fouled by motors and thousands of feet. ’Tis a
very Limbo lake: set between the tireless railways behind and twenty
miles in front the fighting. Drink its cider and paddle in its rushy
streams: and see if you care whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span> you die to-morrow. It brings out a
new part of oneself, the loiterer, neither scorning nor desiring
delights, gliding listlessly through the minutes from meal-time to
meal-time, like the stream through the rushes: or stagnant and smooth
like their cider, unfathomably gold: beautiful and calm without mental
fear. And in four-score hours we will pull up our braces and fight.
These hours will have slipt over me, and I shall march hotly to the
firing-line, by turn critic, actor, hero, coward, and soldier of
fortune: perhaps even for a moment Christian, humble, with “Thy will be
done.” Then shock, combustion, the emergence of one of these: death or
life: and then return to the old rigmarole. I imagine that this, while
it may or may not knock about your body, will make very little
difference to you otherwise.</p>

<p>A speedy relief from Chatham. There is vibration in the air when you
hear “The Battalion will move across the water on....”</p>

<p>The moon won’t rise till late, but there is such placid weariness in all
the bearing earth, that I must go out to see. I have not been “auf dem
Lande” for many years: man muss den Augenblick geniessen. (<i>1 June
1915.</i>)</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Your letter arrived and awoke the now drifting <small>ME</small> to consciousness. I
had understood and acquiesced in your silence. The re-creation of that
self which one is to a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span> is an effort: repaying if it succeeds,
but not to be forced. Wherefore, were it not for the dangers dancing
attendance on the adjourning type of mind&mdash;which a year’s military
training has not been able to efface from me&mdash;I should not be writing to
you now. For it is just after breakfast&mdash;and you know what breakfast is:
putter to sleep of all mental energy and discontent: charmer, sedative,
leveller: maker of Britons. I should wait till after tea when the
undiscriminating sun has shown his back&mdash;a fine back&mdash;on the world, and
oneself by the aid of tea has thrown off the mental sleep of heat. But
after tea I am on duty. So with bacon in my throat and my brain like a
poached egg I will try to do you justice....</p>

<p>I wonder how long it takes the King’s Pawn, who so proudly initiates the
game of chess, to realize that he is a pawn. Same with us. We are
finding out that we play the unimportant if necessary part. At present a
dam, untested, whose presence not whose action stops the stream from
approaching: and then&mdash;a mere handle to steel: dealers of death which we
are not allowed to plan. But I have complained enough before of the
minion state of the “damned foot.” It is something to have no
responsibility&mdash;an inglorious ease of mind....</p>

<p>Health&mdash;and I don’t know what ill-health is&mdash;invites you so much to
smooth and shallow ways: where a happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span> may only be found by
renouncing the other happiness of which one set out in search. Yet here
there is enough to stay the bubbling surface stream. Looking into the
future one sees a holocaust somewhere: and at present there is&mdash;thank
God&mdash;enough of “experience” to keep the wits edged (a callous way of
putting it, perhaps). But out in front at night in that no-man’s land
and long graveyard there is a freedom and a spur. Rustling of the
grasses and grave tap-tapping of distant workers: the tension and
silence of encounter, when one struggles in the dark for moral victory
over the enemy patrol: the wail of the exploded bomb and the animal
cries of wounded men. Then death and the horrible thankfulness when one
sees that the next man is dead: “We won’t have to <i>carry</i> him in under
fire, thank God; dragging will do”: hauling in of the great resistless
body in the dark: the smashed head rattling: the relief, the relief that
the thing has ceased to groan: that the bullet or bomb that made the man
an animal has now made the animal a corpse. One is hardened by now:
purged of all false pity: perhaps more selfish than before. The
spiritual and the animal get so much more sharply divided in hours of
encounter, taking possession of the body by swift turns. (<i>26 August
1915.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span></p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The chess players are no longer waiting so infernal long between their
moves. And the patient pawns are all in movement, hourly expecting
further advances&mdash;whether to be taken or reach the back lines and be
queened. ’Tis sweet, this pawn-being: there are no cares, no doubts:
wherefore no regrets. The burden which I am sure is the parent of
ill-temper drunkenness and premature old age&mdash;to wit, the making up of
one’s own mind&mdash;is lifted from our shoulders. I can now understand the
value of dogma, which is the General Commander-in-chief of the mind. I
am now beginning to think that free thinkers should give their minds
into subjection, for we who have given our actions and volitions into
subjection gain such marvellous rest thereby. Only of course it is the
subjecting of their powers of will and deed to a wrong master on the
part of a great nation that has led Europe into war. Perhaps afterwards,
I and my likes will again become indiscriminate rebels. For the present
we find high relief in making ourselves soldiers. (<i>5 October 1915.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span></p>

<p>When I next come down to Marlborough it shall be an entry worthy of the
place and of the enterer. Not in khaki, with gloves and a little cane,
with creased trousers from Aldershot&mdash;“dyed garments from Bozrah”&mdash;but
in grey bags, an old coat and a knapsack, coming over the downland from
Chiseldon, putting up at the Sun! Then after a night there and a
tattered stroll through the High Street, feeling perhaps the minor
inconveniences of complete communion with Nature, I should put on a
gentlemanly suit and crave admittance at your door, talk old scandal,
search old Housebooks, swank in Court and sing in Chapel and be a
regular O.M.: retaining always the right on Monday afternoon (it always
rains on Mondays in Marlborough) to sweat round Barbury and Totter Down,
what time you dealt out nasty little oblong unseens to the Upper VI.
This would be my Odyssey. At present I am too cornered by my uniform for
any such luxuries. (<i>May 1915.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>There is really very little to say about the life here. Change of
circumstance, I find, means little compared to change of company. And as
one has gone out and is still with the same officers with whom one had
rubbed shoulders unceasingly for the last nine months, and of whom one
had acquired that extraordinarily intimate knowledge which comes of
constant συυουσία, one does not notice the change: until one or two or
three drop off. And one wonders why.</p>

<p>They are extraordinarily close, really, these friendships of
circumstance, distinct as they remain from friendships of choice....
Only, I think, once or twice does one stumble across that person into
whom one fits at once: to whom one can stand naked, all disclosed. But
circumstance provides the second best: and I’m sure that any gathering
of men will in time lead to a very very close half-friendship between
them all (I only say half-friendship because I wish to distinguish it
from the other). So there has really been no change in coming over here:
the change is to come when half of this improvised “band of brothers”
are wiped away in a day. We are learning to be soldiers slowly&mdash;that is
to say, adopting the soldierly attitude of complete disconnection with
our job during odd hours. No shop. So when I think I should tell you
“something about the trenches,” I find I have neither the inclination
nor the power.</p>

<p>This however. On our weekly march from the trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span> back to our old
farmhouse a mile or two behind, we leave the communication-trench for a
road, hedged on one side only, with open ploughland to the right. It
runs a little down hill till the road branches. Then half left up over
open country goes our track, with the ground shelving away to the right
of us. Can you see it? The Toll House to the First Post on Trainers Down
on a small scale. There is something in the way that at the end of the
hedge the road leaps up to the left into the beyond that puts me in mind
of Trainers Down. It is what that turn into unhedged country and that
leap promises, not what it achieves, that makes the likeness. It is
nothing when you get up, no wildness, no openness. But there it remains
to cheer me on each relief....</p>

<p>I hear that a <i>very</i> select group of public schools will by this time be
enjoying the Camp “somewhere in England.” May they not take it too
seriously! Seein’ as ’ow all training is washed out as soon as you turn
that narrow street corner at Boulogne, where some watcher with a lantern
is always up for the English troops arriving, with a “Bon courage” for
every man.</p>

<p>A year ago to-day&mdash;but that way madness lies. (<i>4 August 1915.</i>)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
